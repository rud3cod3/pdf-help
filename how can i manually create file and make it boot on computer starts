# To manually create a file (such as a script) and make it run automatically at boot using systemd, follow these step-by-step instructions. This works for most modern Linux distributions.

1. Write Your Script

Create your script in a safe location, for example `/usr/local/bin/script.sh`:

sudo nano /usr/local/bin/script.sh

Add your code, for example:

#!/bin/bash
echo "Hello, boot!" >> /tmp/boot-log.txt

Save and exit. Then make it executable:

sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/script.sh

2. Create a Systemd Service File

Create a new unit file for your service:

sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/script.service

Paste the following (modify as needed):

----------------------------------------

[Unit]
Description=Run my custom script at boot

[Service]
Type=simple
ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/script.sh

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target

-----------------------------------------

- `Description`: Description of your service
- `ExecStart`: Full path to your script
- `WantedBy=multi-user.target`: Ensures it runs on a normal multi-user (non-graphical) boot[^9][^10][^16].

3. Reload Systemd and Enable the Service

Tell systemd about your new service and enable it to start at boot:

sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable script.service

4. Start and Test the Service

You can start it right away (without rebooting) to test:

sudo systemctl start script.service

To check its status:

sudo systemctl status script.service

5. Verify After Reboot

Reboot your machine:

sudo reboot

After boot, your script should have run. For this example, check `/tmp/boot-log.txt`.

6. To Disable the script

sudo systemctl stop script
sudo systemctl disable script
